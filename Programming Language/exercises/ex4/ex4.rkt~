(provide matches? my-match)


#|
(matches? pattern value)
  pattern: A datum representing a pattern in the grammar specified in the handout.
  value: An integer, list of integers, or nested list of integers.

  Returns #t if the value matches the given pattern, and #f otherwise.

  You may *not* use built-in Racket pattern-matching in your implementation.

  Note: most Racket higher-order list functions (like map and andmap) can take in more
  than one list.
|#
(define (matches? pattern expr)
  (void))


(module+ test
  (require rackunit)

  ; Note that we use `test-true` and `test-false` rather than `test-equal?` here.
  (test-true "Simple numeric pattern" (matches? 3 3))
  (test-true "Simple wildcard pattern" (matches? '_ 5))
  (test-true "Simple fixed-length list pattern" (matches? '(Plist 1 _ 3) (list 1 2 3)))
  (test-false "Simple recursive list pattern" (matches? '(Pcons 1 (Plist _ 3)) (list 1 2 4))))


#|
(my-match expr pairs)
  expr: An integer, list of integers, or nested list of integers.
  pairs: A datum containing a list of lists, where each inner list has exactly two elements:
         a pattern specified by the grammar from the handout, and an arbitrary value.

  For each pair in `pairs`, this function checks whether the given `expr` matches the pattern,
  and if so, returns the corresponding value.

  Assume that `expr` always matches at least one pattern in `pairs`.
  If the expression matches more than one pattern, return the value corresponding to the
  *first* pattern that the expression matches.

  Again, you may *not* use built-in Racket pattern-matching in your implementation.

  Note: this is very similar to the built-in Racket `match` syntactic form,
  although of course we're only considering a very small subset of patterns here.
|#
(define (my-match expr pairs)
  (void))


(module+ test
  (test-equal? "One pair"
               (my-match 4 '((4 "Hello")))
               "Hello")

  (test-equal? "Two pairs"
               (my-match (list 1 2 3) '((4 "Hello")
                                        ((Pcons 1 (Plist _ _)) "Hi")))
               "Hi"))
