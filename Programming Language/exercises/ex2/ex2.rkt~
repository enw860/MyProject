(provide tail-calls call-order)


#|
(tail-calls expr)
  expr: A racket datum with the structure defined on the exercise handout.

  Return a list of function call expressions that are in tail call position
  with respect to the input expression.
|#
(define (tail-calls expr)
  (void))


(module+ test
  (require rackunit)
  ; We've provided test cases for the first two syntactic forms described
  ; in the handout. Please add additional test cases, including ones for the
  ; other forms!
  (test-equal? "Atomic value" (tail-calls 3) null)
  (test-equal? "Simple call" (tail-calls '(+ 1 2)) (list '(+ 1 2)))
  (test-equal? "Nested call"
               (tail-calls '(+ (* 3 4) 2))
               ; NOTE: the outermost expression is in tail-call position,
               ; and it should just be output directly. Don't try to evaluate
               ; the inner '(* 3 4) -- this is harder to do!
               (list '(+ (* 3 4) 2))))


#|
(call-order expr)
  expr: A Racket datum consisting only of atoms and function calls.

  Return a list of Racket data that are the function call expressions in `expr`,
  in the order in which they would be called using left-to-right eager evaluation.
  Every element in the returned list should be a quoted expression that appears
  literally in `expr` -- don't worry about simplifying nested function calls.

  NOTE: The actual implementation turns out to be pretty simple, and should remind
  you of *tree traversals*.
|#
(define (call-order expr)
  (void))


(module+ test
  ; Again, this is a pretty incomplete set of tests! One of the skills you're developing
  ; in this course is how to develop your own test case inputs, often motivated by the
  ; *structure* of the input data.
  (test-equal? "Atomic value" (call-order 3) null)
  (test-equal? "Simple call" (call-order '(+ 1 2)) (list '(+ 1 2)))
  (test-equal? "One nested call"
               (call-order '(+ (* 3 4) 2))
               ; NOTE: the second call is expressed as '(+ (* 3 4) 2), the original
               ; expression itself, rather than what would "actually" be evaluated,
               ; '(+ 12 2). This simplification should make your job easier. :)
               (list '(* 3 4)
                     '(+ (* 3 4) 2))))
